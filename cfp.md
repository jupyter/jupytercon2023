## Talks at JupyterCon 2023

JupyterCon talks are 25 to 30 minutes long.  Talks are organized into the
following tracks:

- **Community: tools and practices** Talks that address the community
  tooling and best practices in the Jupyter ecosystem. Community tools include
  frontends, kernels, extensions, and other tools in the Jupyter ecosystem.
  Community practices include how Jupyter is used in a workflow and
  introspection into the Jupyter community itself.

- **Enterprise Jupyter Infrastructure**: Talks that address deploying Jupyter
  and JupyterHub at scale in industry, government, high-performance computing,
  science, education, and other settings. Topics include DevOps, scaling
  services, security concerns, regulation compliance, and more.

- **Jupyter in Education**: Talks that address how to teach and learn using
  Jupyter in a variety of settings.

- **Jupyter for scientific discoveries** Talks that address how Jupyter is
  used in specific scientific research fields, such as medical research,
  astronomy, physics, climate change, meteorology, and more. Data science
  applications

- **Data Science** Talks that address how Jupyter is used by data
  science practitioners in industry, government, and elsewhere. 

- **Others** Talks that address anything else (as long as it's relevant to the
  Jupyter)

## Posters at JupyterCon 2020

The poster session is a forum for ideas to be presented in a concise, visually
appealing way. Posters can be work in progress or the highlights of a project
you would like to share and discuss. Posters are shared as a static pdf file.
We also encourage you to consider linking to an ‘executable’ and ‘interactive’
poster, such as a Voilà dashboard. Show us how you tell stories with Jupyter.

Anyone is welcome to submit a poster, including researchers, practitioners,
enthusiasts, and students.

A poster presentation consists of:

    A small thumbnail image (JPG or PNG) for our poster gallery (1280x720 pixels)
    A poster pdf file (preferred size: A2, 16.5 x 23.4 inches)
    A short description, which may include a link to an interactive site, such as a Voilà dashboard

## Guidelines for proposing a talk or poster

### Speaker Profile

To propose a talk or poster, you will first need to create a speaker profile.
This includes information such as your name (as you would like it to appear in
the conference program), and the following optional information, which will be
published as a part of the conference program if your talk is accepted:

    - a short biography telling the audience a little about you
    - a photo
    - a GitHub and/or Twitter handles to connect with you

The primary presenter should submit the proposal, and afterwards the proposal
can be edited to add other authors.

Can the speaker profile be edited after acceptance, so that we don't require
unnecessary informations.

### Proposal

A talk or poster proposal must include the following information that will be
listed publicly in the conference program for accepted talks or posters.

- Title: Give your talk a title that accurately describes its content and
  focus to the potential attendees.

- Audience: Describe what level of programming/coding and other topic-specific
  knowledge, experience or expertise your talk is aiming for. Will the
  attendees need multiple skills or proficiency in tools other than Jupyter
  notebooks?

  ‘Advanced’, ‘Intermediate’, and ‘Beginner’ may mean different things to
  different people. Feel free to include any additional details regarding
  prerequisites for your talk, as well as what audience may benefit from it.

- A summary: Submit a summary describing the topic and key takeaways for
  attendees. The description will be included in the conference program
  announcements, should it be selected.

  After reading this summary, the audience should have an idea of the overall
  presentation and know what to expect. 

- Your affiliation: for the purposes of this talk or poster. 

## Talk and poster proposal submission FAQs

- What can I do to increase the likelihood of my talk/poster being accepted?

    Here are some common pitfalls that could lead to the proposal being rejected:

        - Submit early. Submissions can be modified up until the submission deadline.

	- Ensure your talk will appeal to the wider Jupyter community. If your
	  talk topic addresses a narrow segment of issues, users, or
	  applications, consider shifting focus or highlighting best practices
	  and themes that apply to a more general audience, or consider
	  submitting a more narrowly-focused poster. People from many fields
	  and backgrounds attend JupyterCon, which can lead to rich
	  discussions among attendees that would not normally have a chance to
	  interact with each other. What lessons have you learned that can
	  benefit others in the Jupyter community that may not be from your
	  specific field or application?

	- Take a look at the JupyterCon 2017, 2018, and 2020 conference
	  schedules for previously accepted talks. Clearly identify who your
	  target audience is, what background is required for attendees to
	  benefit from your presentation, and what the key takeaways are. Get
	  feedback, especially from those in your target audience.

-  What should I avoid in my talk proposal?

    Here are some common pitfalls that could lead to the proposal being rejected:

        - **Overly long proposal** Keep it simple, clear and focused.
	- **Future work** While talking about future work is interesting and
	  could be mentioned in your talk, the core content of the talk should
	  already be shaped, and you should be able to describe it in your
	  proposal.
	- **Sales pitches** We are a community of open source developers and
	  users of open source scientific computing tools. You can reference
	  your closed-source product or platform, but the audience will find
	  the talk more interesting if they can try your techniques within the
	  Jupyter ecosystem. Your problem definition, proposed techniques,
	  broad issues you solved, and business domain might be interesting,
	  but sales pitches and "how to use our product" talks are typically
	  rejected.
	- **Repeated Talk** We have a strong preference for new material and
	  fresh faces, and as such, if your talk is already available online
	  it is unlikely to be accepted for the conference.
